What is LZO ?
=============

LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory.

In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at
this very high speed.


What is Python ?
================

Python is an interpreted object-oriented programming language, and is
often compared to Tcl, Perl, Java or Scheme. To find out more, point
your browser to http://www.python.org/ .


What is Python-LZO ?
====================

Python-LZO provides Python bindings for LZO, i.e. you can access
the LZO library from your Python scripts thereby compressing ordinary
Python strings.


Where's the documentation ?
===========================

Python-LZO comes with built-in documentation which is accessible
using `lzo.__doc__' and `lzo.func__doc__'. See "Chapter 3: Data Model"
in the Python Reference Manual for more information.

Additionally you should read the docs and study the example
programs that ship with the LZO library. Really.
