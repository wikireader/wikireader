	* [r1522] drivers/gpib/sys/osinit.c: Patch from Ken McIvor
	  <mcivor@iit.edu>:
	  
	  We've heard via a Debian bug report that the module-init-tools
	  authors
	  are pushing to eliminate as many files as possible from `/etc/
	  modprobe.d':
	  
	  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=518241
	  
	  The attached patch uses the MODULE_ALIAS_CHARDEV_MAJOR() macro to
	  establish a built-in alias to the gpib_common module, as per
	  their
	  recommendation. I've tested it against Debian "sid" without the
	  `/etc/
	  modprobe.d/gpib' file and everything appears to work fine.

	  drivers/gpib/sys/ibinit.c, drivers/gpib/sys/osinit.c: Fixed
	  compilation on 2.6.27 kernel by switching autospoll thread over

2008-09-19 02:26  fmhess

	* [r1516] language/python/Gpib.py, language/python/gpibinter.c:
	  Patch from Dan Lenski <dlenski@gmail.com>:
	  
	  * fixed error handling to get errno from the right place
	  * __doc__ strings for every function (modeled on the ones Keith
	  had written)
	  * a few function names made less terse:
	  cmd->command
	  tmo->timeout
	  trg->trigger
	  * integer constants for IbaXXXX and IbcXXXX added to the module
	  * all functions--that don't have something else useful to
	  return--return
	  ibsta, just like the C versions
	  * the read() function now puts its result directly into the
	  Python output
	  string, with /no copying/ from a C string to a Python string.
	  This should
	  improve efficiency of large and/or frequent reads.

2008-09-18 00:56  fmhess

2006-08-23 14:45  fmhess

	  real this time) that we have dealt with races between
	  timeouts and END being detected on dma reads. Also added
	  eastwood_hybrid
	  board type, which uses dma for writes but not for reads.

2006-06-13 02:09  fmhess

	* [r1384] driver/eastwood/eastwood_gpib.c: Make absolutely sure END
	  status is in sync with transfer count

	  missing them.

2006-06-05 22:59  fmhess

	* [r1382] driver/sys/osfuncs.c: suppress read errors when we have

2005-10-29 21:43  fmhess

	* [r1309] lib/ibCmd.c: Protocol book says order of send_setup

	* [r1301] driver/ines/ines_init.c, driver/ines/ines_read.c,
	  driver/ines/ines_write.c: Avoid use of INES_AUX_CLR_IN_FIFO and
	  INES_AUX_CLR_OUT_FIFO as they
	  seem to be buggy. Bad behaviour where first byte written would
	  have EOI asserted when acting as device has been fixed by this
	  change.

2005-10-17 00:56  fmhess

	* [r1300] examples/ibtest.c: show results of timed out reads

2005-10-16 23:41  fmhess

	  stuck in ibread loop

2005-10-16 21:56  fmhess

	* [r1297] driver/include/Makefile.am, driver/include/nec7210.h,
	  driver/include/nec7210_registers.h: split nec7210_registers.h out
	  of nec7210.h as suggested by
	  roucaries bastien <roucaries.bastien@gmail.com>

2005-10-16 21:51  fmhess

	  Added support for returning errors from
	  gpib_interface_t::enable_eos
	  for the case of the Agilent 82357a which can't do 7 bit eos
	  compares. Added support for querying support of 7 bit compares
	  through
	  ibask() (option = Iba7BitEOS). This breaks binary compatibility
	  between the lib and kernel, since the board_info_ioctl_t has
	  gotten
	  a new member.

2005-10-16 17:29  fmhess

	* [r1295] driver/agilent_82357a/agilent_82357a.c,
	  driver/agilent_82357a/agilent_82357a.h, driver/nec7210/util.c:
	  Fixed problems in agilent_82357a driver where more important
	  operations could fail
	  due to the board being busy in update_status or line_status. Made
	  everything block on mutex except update_status and line_status
	  (which
	  are likely to be called hopelessly when an async io operation is
	  in
	  progress). update_status and line_status try nonblocking lock of
	  mutex
	  and return immeditately on error.

2005-10-10 20:45  fmhess

	* [r1294] driver/sys/ibread.c, driver/sys/ibwrite.c,
	  test/Makefile.am, test/README, test/libgpib_test.c, test/runtest:
	  Changed libgpib_test to synchronize through stdin/stdout. Fixed
	  bogus test failure in lockout test. Removed some debug spam to
	  kernel logs.

2005-10-10 20:30  fmhess

	* [r1293] driver/ines/ines_read.c, driver/ines/interrupt.c: Fixed

2005-10-10 15:01  fmhess

	* [r1292] AUTHORS, TODO, driver/include/gpib_types.h,
	  driver/sys/osfuncs.c, lib/ibOnl.c: don't require board mutex to

	  CLRSC
	  backwards (the tnt5002 manual is wrong). I don't know why this
	  change seemed to fix my nec7210 atgpib board a few weeks ago, but
	  the
	  nec7210 based board is working fine now with CLRSC=2 and SETSC=3
	  (and
	  it displays the same problem with not being able to set the REN
	  line
	  if you use SETSC=2 and CLRSC=2)..

	  than underscore for sed 's' command delimiter
